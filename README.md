## ü§î Why Yardstick?

Yardstick was created out of a need for a simple, no-frills budgeting tool that puts users in control of their own data. Unlike many commercial budgeting apps that require you to link bank accounts or store sensitive information on third-party servers, Yardstick allows you to self-host your entire financial dashboard. This focus on privacy, combined with a clean, intuitive interface, makes it a great alternative for those who value simplicity and data ownership.
